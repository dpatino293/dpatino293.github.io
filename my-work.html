            <h2>Some of Daniel's Work</h2>
            <br>
            <p>For my LIS 350 class I had to submit an object/design that was not an essay about one of the topics we had covered in that unit, so I decided to recreate the way books were binded together. Through this assignment I practiced stitching for the first time! Here is the video where I recorded that process: <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Uvw7veIc0Jw">Unessay - LIS 350</a> </strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>The image below represents my group's LIS 470 project. For this assignment we were tasked to create an application that would solve a problem that we may face. As a group we decided to create an application that made the coffee ordering process smooth and simple.</p>

            <h2>Some of the elements we focused on for this project:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure that it is user friendly. We did this by conducting many contextual inquiries.</li>
                <li>Team work! We all made sure to put in the same effort.</li>
                <li>Choose a topic that can help a wide range of individuals.</li>
            </ol>

            <br>

            <p>The image below shows some of the posts/flyers that I have created for my fraternity! I am not the best drawer, but when it comes to Canva <em> I enjoy letting my imagination steer the wheel! </em></p>

                    <td>Review: 10/10. I was never a fan of country music, but this song has changed my mind. </td>

            <p>A personal project that I have is to try and listen to various genres. Above I put a list of songs and my review.</p>
