            <h2>About Daniel</h2>
            <p>Hi everybody! My name is Daniel Patino and I am a senior studying Information Science with two certificates in Data Science and Chicano Latino Studies. Some of my hobbies include playing sports, mostly soccer, and cooking. I am not the best cook, but watching cooking shows motivates me to get creative in the kitchen. This past summer I spent my time here in Madison as an AASPIRE Intern with the Madison Fire Department. It was my first internship, but I really enjoyed the experience. I helped out wherever I could, but the main focus of the internship was to help with data management. I highly recommend if you are staying here over the summer to apply for this internship! I met some amazing people and you get a lot of hands-on experience. Outside of this I went to California and enjoyed the nice weather and beaches. I am currently working on what my life will look like after I graduate by applying to many full time jobs. I donâ€™t know exactly what position I want to have, but I know I want to start to work as soon as possible in some sort of IT position or Project Management. By starting right away I hope to grow on the experience I currently have and support my parents financially with whatever I can. </p>
